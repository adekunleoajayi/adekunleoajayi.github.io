The European Geosciences Union, General Assembly is the biggest gathering for geoscience community in Europe. Every year, the assembly brings together geoscientists from all over the world to one meeting, covering all disciplines of the Earth, planetary and space sciences. </p>

EGU provides a platform for scientists, especially early career researchers, to present their work and discuss their ideas with experts in all fields of geoscience. This year, I was opportuned to attend the EGU 2017 meeting and I gave a presentation on my just concluded master thesis, which was about the laboratory modelling of the interaction of currents and topography in the Antarctic Circumpolar current. I was intrigued by the large number of scientists that attended the conference, giving my first international talk to such a great audience was also interesting for me. Aside from the scientific expenditure, attending EGU was also an opportunity to explore the beautiful city of Vienna. </p>
