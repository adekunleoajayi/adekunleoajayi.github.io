The Ocean sciences meeting is a biennial scientific meeting for marine oriented specialists around the world. It is the largest of such gathering with organised sessions that includes all aspect of oceanography research. This year's meeting took place in Portland and I was happy to present my work during one of the poster sessions. </p>
