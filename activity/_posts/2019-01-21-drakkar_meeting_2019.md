Drakkar workshop is an annual scientific gathering, where NEMO based ocean model users discuss scientific results, progress achieved with the model configuration and also future plans to improve the model development. During the meeting, I gave a talk on the regimes of inverse energy cascade in ocean mesoscale inertial range based on the outputs of two submesoscale permitting ocean models NATL60 and HYCOM50.
