"TURBINTERMARS is aimed at exploring the “trade zones” between turbulence and Earth Sciences and it's focused on boundary layer-sediment interactions at different scales, from micro to macro scales, from observatory, experimental to numerical investigations, and applications in hydraulics."

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
"TURBINTERMARS is mainly devoted to PhD students and young researchers working in interdisciplinary fields of geology, geophysical fluid dynamics, hydraulics, and multiphase turbulence with focus on interface interaction at the bottom boundary of the water systems."
